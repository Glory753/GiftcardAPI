Project 1

My name is Gloria Ramirez
My Project 1 was based on a Giftcard business idea.
I was excited about the Frontend, that the Backend was included into the idea afterwards...

My project:
Is a Full stack app

Includes:
Backend using a SQL database 
Javalin as the web framework 
Javascript as the front end technology 
A user-friendly website interface
It follows the 3 layer architecture (web layer / service layer / persistence layer)
Unit Testing for backend service layer 
API follows RESTful convention 
CSS styling, multiple pages, and a nice user experience

Excluded:
Logging to file (only done on 09/11 and 09/13)
Cloud DB on Azure
